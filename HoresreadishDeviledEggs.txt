Not your standard deviled eggs, these are bright from the addition of vinegar and horseradish and are broiled just before serving.
ingredients
12 hard-boiled large eggs, peeled, halved lengthwise
1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
2 teaspoons Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
Kosher salt
1/4 cup fine fresh breadcrumbs
preparation

Preheat broiler. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise, horseradish, vinegar, and mustard in a medium bowl until smooth. Season with salt and spoon back into egg whites. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over.

Place eggs on a broiler-proof baking sheet and broil, watching closely to prevent burning, until breadcrumbs are toasted, about 3 minutes.

DO AHEAD: Deviled eggs can be filled (not sprinkled with breadcrumbs) up to 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
